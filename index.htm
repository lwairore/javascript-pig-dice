                        <strong>Pig Dice</strong> is a simple dice game. As with many games of folk origin, Pig is
                        played with many rule variations. The dominant type of decision is whether or not to jeopardize
                        previous gains by rolling for potential greater gains.

                        <hr>
                        Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die unti either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to
                        "hold":
                        <ul>
                            <li>If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next player's turn.</li>
                            <li>If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player's
                                turn continues.</li>
                            <li>If a player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes
                                the next player's turn.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <br>
                        The first player to score 100 or more points wins.
                        <hr>
                        <h4>Example,</h4>
                        <p>For example, the first player, Anne, begins a turn with a roll of 5. Anne could hold and
                            score 5 points, but chooses to roll again. Anne rolls a 2, and could hold with a turn total
                            of 7 points, but chooses to roll again. Anne rolls a 1, and must end her turn without
                            scoring. The next player, Bob, rolls the sequence 4-5-3-5-5, after which he chooses to hold,
                            and adds his turn total of 22 points to his score.</p>

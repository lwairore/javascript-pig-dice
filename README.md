# Play PIG-DICE
PIG DICE is a game for 2-6 players

## Rules
The aim of the game is to get 100 points. 

Players take turns to roll the dice as may times as they like, adding the numbers as they go. A player can end their turn any time and 'bank' their points.

**BUT** if a player rolls a 1, they lose all their unbanked points and their turn is over. 

The first player to score 100 or more points wins.

**For example:** 
It is Ben's turn and he throws a 2, 5, 4 and 3. His total so far is 14.

What shall he do now? Shall he throw again and hope that he doesn't throw a 1? If he throws a 1 he will lose all 14 points. Or shall he bank his 14 points so that they are and end his go?

Calculating Kate has banked 20 points form the first turn. On her next turn she throws 2, 6 and 5 so she has 13 points unbanked. What shall she do? Bank the 13 points and add them to her 20 points so that she has a tota of 33? Or throw again? If she throws a 1 she will lose her 13 points.

The first player to attain a total of 100 or more points wins!
